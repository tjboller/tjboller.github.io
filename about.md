About Me
---
Hello!

I am a data person focusing on the life sciences living in the New York Area. 
I've worked for Massachusetts 
General Hospital, IBM Watson Health, and BenevolentAI. 

I view myself as a generalist, somewhere between a bioinformation, SWE, 
machine learning, and product manager. I like to find hidden problems 
and solve them as simply as I can. 

You can check out my a patent application for a method for prioritizing
biological targets for potential medications <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2021111113" target="_blank">here</a>

I'm a curious person and I am often confronted with cool data problems in my daily life and hobbies. 
This is a space where I explore those curiosities.

I am a proud father and husband. I love music, gardening, food, pop culture, 
beating my brother in super smash bros, and learning the piano.
